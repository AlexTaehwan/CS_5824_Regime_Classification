## Using smart beta factors as input for Random Forest time series classification
## "Machine Learning in finance is like using an image classifier to identify a zebra, and the zebra is constantly changing colors." - Michael Kearns

Herein, we aim to identify periods where the zebra's colors are consistant, using smart beta factors as input to time series classification methods.
